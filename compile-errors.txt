Compiler Errors
---------------

I have made small changes to working code to generate these compiler 
errors (red in IDE). Things to remember:

(1) The first error (line shown here) is always where you start, but the
second error may be part of the same thing and more informative.

(2) You don't need to know the code at all in order to fix these errors
(in one case you need to make an informed guess)

(3) One good strategy - if you find these errors hard - is to program
in smaller chunks where you use locals to break up expressions and check
the types of everything as you code. This is preventative and also helps you
learn what the types of the code you use are.
